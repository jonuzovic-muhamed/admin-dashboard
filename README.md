# Admin Dashboard Project

## About

This project is part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a>, which I undertook in order to increase my knowledge in modern web development.

For this project I created a simple Admin Dashboard using vanilla HTML and CSS.
The main focus was implementing CSS Grid for the first time in a project after learning about it.
